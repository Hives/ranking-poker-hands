# Ranking poker hands

This is an exercise I've picked to work on to develop two of the target areas
for Makers Week 1:
- Test driven development
- Object oriented programming

It's a [Codewars
kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/ranking-poker-hands/train/ruby) that I've
chosen because it features OOP elemenst, and I'm going to develop a solution by
writing my own tests in TDD style using RSpec.
